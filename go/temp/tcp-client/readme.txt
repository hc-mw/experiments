// The client code is much simpler than the server code.
	// We only need to connect to the server and send data.
	// The server will respond with the same data.
	// We don't need to handle multiple connections or errors.
	// We can just connect, send, and receive data.
	// The server will handle the rest.
	// This is the beauty of the TCP protocol.
	// It abstracts away the complexity of handling multiple connections.
	// We can just focus on sending and receiving data.
	// The server will handle the rest.
	// This is the power of the TCP protocol.
	// It allows us to build robust and scalable network applications.
	// We can build client-server applications that can handle thousands of connections.
	// We can build distributed systems that can scale to millions of users.
	// We can build real-time applications that can process millions of events per second.
	// The possibilities are endless.
	// We just need to understand the fundamentals of the TCP protocol.
	// We need to understand how to connect, send, and receive data.
	// We need to understand how to handle errors and recover from failures.
	// We need to understand how to build robust and scalable network applications.
	// We need to understand how to build distributed systems that can scale to millions of users.
	// We need to understand how to build real-time applications that can process millions of events per second.
	// The TCP protocol is the foundation of the Internet.
	// It is the backbone of the World Wide Web.
	// It is the enabler of modern communication.
	// It is the key to building the next generation of network applications.
	// We just need to understand how to use it.
	// We just need to understand how to leverage its power.
	// We just need to understand how to build amazing things with it.
	// Let's start by building a simple TCP client.
	// We will connect to a server and send some data.
	// The server will respond with the same data.
	// We will print the response to the console.
	// Let's get started.
	// First, we need to import the necessary packages.
	// We need the "net" package to connect to the server.
	// We need the "fmt" package to print the response to the console.
	// Let's import the packages.
	// Next, we need to define the address of the server.
	// We will connect to the server running on localhost at port 8080.
	// Let's define the address.
